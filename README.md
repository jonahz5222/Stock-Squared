# Stock-Squared

## The Issue
Stock profiles have a lot of information, and it's easy to look at individual stock profiles and determine their growth rate. But what if you want to watch large numbers of stocks at once? It's hard to digest large quantities of information on all sorts of stocks.

## The Solution
Enter "insert name here". "insert name here" is an iOS application for investors on the go who need lots of information, fast. The screen is divided into 12 economic sectors: 
* Energy
* Materials
* Industrials
* Consumer Goods
* Health Care
* Financials
* Technology
* Telecommunication Services
* Utilities
* Real Estate
* Consumer Services
* Media
each of which contains 12 stocks that belong to that sector. Each stock is color a varying shade of red(decline) or green(growth), the intensity of which varies on the value of the growth rate. Users can select individual stocks to see a detailed graph of the stock's history.

## The How
